//Classs........!!!!


//class is nothing but Object.create and extends is nothing but its prototype


//class has a constructor where you can set the args thta yyou pass



//super in consructor will call the constructior of the class/object you are extending

//class is just a synctatical sugar i.e -> class dodnt change the way objects work under the hood ...it do the same thing as Object.create do
